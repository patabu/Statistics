              <p><strong>Empirical Distribution Variability:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>When the number of samples is small, the empirical distribution exhibits higher variability.</li>
                  <li>This happens because each sample has a significant impact on the distribution, and random fluctuations are more pronounced.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Noticeable Differences Between Distributions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The empirical distribution tends to deviate more significantly from the theoretical distribution.</li>
                  <li>Empirical mean and variance often differ substantially from their theoretical counterparts.</li>

              <p><strong>Effect on the Graph:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>As the number of samples increases, the empirical distribution progressively aligns with the theoretical distribution.</li>
                  <li>Random variability is reduced as more samples "smooth out" local discrepancies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Means and Variances:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The empirical mean starts converging toward the theoretical mean, as guaranteed by the <em>Law of Large Numbers</em>.</li>
                  <li>Similarly, the empirical variance approaches the theoretical variance, better capturing the data's spread.</li>

              <p><strong>Empirical vs. Theoretical Distribution:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>With 5000 samples, the empirical distribution closely follows the theoretical distribution.</li>
                  <li>The green bars (empirical) and yellow bars (theoretical) are almost overlapping.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Convergence of Mean and Variance:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The empirical mean (7.837) and the theoretical mean (7.967) are very close.</li>
                  <li>The empirical variance (18.662) is nearly identical to the theoretical variance (18.604).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Overall Convergence:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>This behavior is explained by the <em>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</em>, which ensures that with enough samples, the empirical distribution becomes a faithful representation of the theoretical one.</li>

            <h2>4. Conclusions on the Effect of Sample Size</h2>
            <p><strong>With Few Samples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The empirical distribution may deviate significantly from the theoretical one.</li>
                <li>Empirical means and variances show more noticeable discrepancies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>With Many Samples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The empirical distribution becomes increasingly similar to the theoretical distribution.</li>
                <li>Empirical means and variances converge toward the theoretical values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Limits and Observations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Although 5000 samples represent a significant number, small discrepancies remain, which would diminish further with an even larger sample size.</li>
                <li>The marginal gain decreases as the number of samples increases: beyond a certain point, adding more samples yields negligible improvements.</li>
