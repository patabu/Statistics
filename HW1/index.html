                <h2>Homework 1 (T): Basic Concepts of Statistics</h2>

                <h3>Population</h3>
                <p>
                    In statistics, the term "population" refers to the entire collection of elements or observations that possess a common characteristic and are the subject of a study.
                    A population can be considered as a wide range of subjects, including individuals, objects, events, or measurements and it doesn't necessarily have to be study of something physically real, but even abstract.
                    It's useful to know that a Population it's not strictly a static or fixed collection, but it can be dynamic too, such as a stream of data.
                    To conclude, we are going to consider a population a set of statiscal units.

                </p>

                <h3>Statistical Units</h3>
                <p>
                    Statistical units are the individual elements that compose a population. Each unit represents a single observation or measurement of a statistical study. For instance, in a study of student performance, each student would be considered a statistical unit. A proper definition of statistical units ensures that the data collected is relevant and representative of the population being studied.
                    When observing a statistical unit, we are technically observing its character or variables.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Characters</strong>: represent the abstract properties that define the statistical units that we are observing, such as age, height, weight of people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>variables</strong>: represent the actual values of each character given an actual person (statistical unit), for example age: 22, height: 182cm,  weight: 75kg.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Speaking about variables, we can define two ways to measure them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quantitatively</strong>: e.g. 180cm when we are observing the height of a statistical unit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Qualitatively</strong>: e.g. Medium (so we are defining categories considered as a subset of the quantitative values, as “Medium” where we consider a range of values like 170cm-185cm)
                    </li>
                </ul>                   
                <h3>Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    In statistics, the concept of distribution refers to the way in which the values of a particular variable are spread across a population of interest.
                    A population is defined as the entire set of individuals or items that share a common characteristic, while statistical units are the individual elements within that population from which data is collected. 
                    The distribution illustrates how these statistical units vary in relation to the variable being measured, providing insights into patterns, trends, and anomalies. 
                    Understanding the distribution of a variable is crucial for analyzing the behavior of the population, as it allows researchers to identify central tendencies, variability, and potential outliers within the data.
                    Common types of distributions include normal, binomial, and uniform distributions, each of which describes a different way in which values can be arranged within a population.
                </p>
                <h3>Average</h3>
                <p>
                    The mean is a fundamental statistical measure used to describe a set of numerical data. It is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing the total by the number of values.
                    This measure provides a central representation of the data, allowing for the identification of trends and general behaviors.
                    The mean is particularly useful in various fields, such as economics, science, and education, for analyzing performance, trends, and distributions.
                    However, it is important to note that the mean can be influenced by extreme values or outliers, which can make it less representative in some cases.
                    In such instances, other measures, such as the median or mode, may provide a more accurate picture of the data distribution.
                </p>
                <h3>Computational problems with Floating-Point Representation</h3>
                <p>
                    Floating-point representation is a widely used method for approximating real numbers in computer systems.
                    While it enables computers to handle a vast range of values, it also introduces several computational problems that can significantly affect numerical accuracy and reliability.
                    These problems stem from the inherent limitations of representing real numbers in a finite number of bits, leading to phenomena such as rounding errors and catastrophic cancellation.
                    Understanding these issues is essential for developing robust algorithms and ensuring accurate computational results in scientific and engineering applications.
                </p>
                <h3>Rounding errors</h3>
                <p>
                    Rounding errors occur when a number cannot be precisely represented in floating-point format due to the limited precision available.
                    Since computers use a fixed number of bits to store numerical values, many real numbers cannot be expressed exactly.
                    For example, the decimal number 0.1 does not have an exact representation in binary, leading to a small discrepancy when it is stored.
                    When arithmetic operations are performed on these approximated values, the errors can accumulate, resulting in significant inaccuracies in the final result.
                    Rounding errors can be particularly problematic in iterative calculations or when performing operations on large datasets, as even tiny errors can propagate and magnify over time.
                    To mitigate rounding errors, careful numerical analysis and appropriate algorithms should be employed, ensuring that the impact of these inaccuracies is minimized.
                </p>
                <h3>Catastrophic cancellation</h3>
                <p>
                    Catastrophic cancellation is a specific type of error that occurs during the subtraction of two nearly equal floating-point numbers. 
                    When two values that are very close together are subtracted, the significant digits may be lost, leading to a result that has a much larger relative error.
                    This happens because the precision of floating-point representation is limited; thus, the loss of significant digits can overshadow the actual difference between the two numbers.
                    For example, if two values, such as 1.000001 and 1.000000, are subtracted, the resulting difference might be inaccurately represented, resulting in a significant error.
                    Catastrophic cancellation is especially critical in calculations involving polynomials, numerical integration, and other mathematical operations where precision is paramount. 
                    To avoid catastrophic cancellation, alternative formulations of algorithms should be considered, such as using higher precision arithmetic or restructuring equations to minimize the loss of significant digits.
