        <h1>Statistical Independence</h1>
        <p>
          Statistical independence between two events, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, means that the occurrence of
          one event does not provide any information about the occurrence of the other.
          In probability theory, this concept is formalized by saying that events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
          are independent if:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \]
        </div>
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>P(A)</em> is the probability of event <em>A</em>,</li>
          <li><em>P(B)</em> is the probability of event <em>B</em>,</li>
          <li><em>P(A ∩ B)</em> is the probability of both events occurring together (their intersection).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Illustrative Example: Rolling Dice</h2>
        <p>
          Consider rolling two six-sided dice. Define events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>A</em>: The first die shows a 4.</li>
          <li><em>B</em>: The second die shows an even number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since the outcome of one die roll does not influence the outcome of the other, events <em>A</em> and
          <em>B</em> are independent. We can verify this:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(A) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
        </div>
        <p>
          The probability of both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> occurring is:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(A \cap B) = P(\text{first die shows 4 and second die is even}) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
          = \frac{1}{12} \]
        </div>
        <p>
          Thus, <em>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B)</em>, confirming that <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are independent.
        </p>

        <h2>Random Variables and Independence</h2>
        <p>
          For random variables, independence means that the joint distribution of the variables can be
          separated into the product of their individual distributions.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Independent Random Variables</h3>
        <p>
          Consider two independent random variables <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>X</em> represents the outcome of a fair six-sided die, taking values 1, 2, ..., 6,</li>
          <li><em>Y</em> represents the outcome of a fair coin flip, taking values 0 (tails) or 1 (heads).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The probability distribution for <em>X</em> is:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} \quad \text{for } x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \]
        </div>
        <p>
          The probability distribution for <em>Y</em> is:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(Y = y) = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{for } y = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
        </div>
        <p>
          Since <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are independent, the probability that <em>X = x</em> and <em>Y =
            y</em> can be calculated as:
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y) = P(X = x) \cdot P(Y = y) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{2} =
          \frac{1}{12} \]
        </div>

        <h2>Conditional Independence</h2>
        <p>
          Two events can also be conditionally independent given a third event. This means that, given the
          third event, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Conditional Independence in Disease Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose we are testing for a disease. Define the following events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>D</em>: A person has the disease.</li>
          <li><em>T</em>: The test result is positive.</li>
          <li><em>S</em>: The person is a smoker.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If <em>T</em> and <em>S</em> are conditionally independent given <em>D</em>, then knowing whether a
          person smokes does not affect the test result for the disease if we already know whether they have
          the disease.
        </p>
        <div>
          \[ P(T \cap S \mid D) = P(T \mid D) \cdot P(S \mid D) \]
        </div>

        <h2>Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) Random Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Independence is also essential in defining a collection of random variables as independent and
          identically distributed (i.i.d.). This property is key to many statistical theories, such as the Law
          of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Repeated Coin Tosses</h3>
        <p>
          If we toss a fair coin multiple times, each outcome (heads or tails) can be considered as a random
          variable. Let:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub></em> be the outcomes of <em>n</em> coin
            tosses, where each <em>X<sub>i</sub></em> is a random variable that takes the value 1 for heads
            and 0 for tails.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These random variables are i.i.d., meaning:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Each <em>X<sub>i</sub></em> has the same probability distribution: \[ P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2}
            \] and \[ P(X_i = 0) = \frac{1}{2} \].</li>
          <li>They are independent: the outcome of one toss does not affect the outcome of another.</li>
        </ol>
